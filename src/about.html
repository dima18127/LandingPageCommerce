                <h3>Our production</h3>
                <p>From the first years of work in the solid fuel business it became clear that we can't do
                    without our own production facilities.
                    But, as you know, it is not a problem to buy equipment and find competent specialists, how to find a quality, constantly updated raw material base, which will provide a continuous process of producing briquettes or pellets all year round. <br><br>
                    So in 2013 began our endless trips to major woodworking companies in Russia. And by the summer of 2014 we managed to find a large enterprise in the Kirov region, with which we partnered to install our first press from the German company "RuF". After a short installation and commissioning we were able to reach operating capacity and produce 7-9 tons of briquettes per day in two shifts. Having successfully implemented this project, we decided not to stop the production of wood briquettes and in 2016 the first pelletizer OGM-1.5 was installed in Belokholunitsky district of Kirov region, which allows to produce more than 1 ton of premium wood pellets per hour. <br><br>
                    At the moment we have one production of wood briquettes and two production of pellets. The total capacity is 200-220 tons of briquettes per month and 800-900 tons of pellets per month

                <h3>Our production</h3>
                    <p>It's no secret that for the successful development and exploration of new markets - you can not stand still and trade in one or two types of fuel. <br><br>
                        We have 4 types of RuF wood briquettes only:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix briquette (made of coniferous and birch sawdust)</li>
                        <li>Birch "dust" briquette (made of birch wood flour)</li>
                        <li>Briquettes of oak dust (from oak wood flour),</li>
                        <li>Mixture of birch "dust" briquettes with the addition of wood chips (70-80% birch flour, the rest is birch chips).</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p>Besides RuF briquettes we also sell such briquettes as Pini-Kay, Nielsen and Nestro, packed in 10 kg shrink-wrapped film.
